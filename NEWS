Changes in version 1.15:

Lzip now shows the progress of compression at verbosity level 2 (-vv).

Decompressing and testing no more show file version.

Option "-n, --threads" is now accepted and ignored for compatibility
with plzip.

The configure script now accepts options with a separate argument.

The chapter "Stream format" and the appendix "Reference source code"
have been added to the manual.
