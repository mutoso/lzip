Changes in version 1.3:

This version automatically chooses the smallest possible dictionary size
for each file during compression, saving memory during decompression.

This version is able to decompress version 1 files that will be produced
by lzip 1.4. Version 1 files include the size of the compressed data.
This will facilitate safe recovery of undamaged members from multimember
files.
