Changes in version 1.18:

The option "-a, --trailing-error", which makes lzip exit with error
status 2 if any remaining input is detected after decompressing the last
member, has been added.

Decompression time has been reduced by 2%.

The test of the value remaining in the range decoder has been removed.
(After extensive testing it has been found useless to detect corruption
in the decompressed data. Eliminating it reduces the number of false
positives for corruption and makes error detection more accurate).

When decompressing, the file specified with the '--output' option is now
deleted if the input is a terminal.

Decompression support for version 0 files has been removed.

The new chapter "Trailing data" has been added to the manual.

A harmless check failure on Windows, caused by the failed comparison of
a message in text mode, has been fixed.
