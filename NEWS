Changes in version 1.5:

Codification of dictionary size in file header has been changed. At
least lzip 1.4 is needed to decompress files produced by lzip 1.5.

A problem that prevented compilation with GCC 4.4 has been fixed.

"--member-size" and "--volume-size" have been made more accurate.

Compression ratio and speed have been improved at the cost of 4MiB more
of RAM.

Compression speed has been doubled for dictionary sizes < 64KiB.

The chapter "Algorithm" has been added to the manual.

Lzdiff and lzgrep now accept "-h" for "--help" and "-V" for "--version".

Man page is now installed by default.
