Changes in version 1.2:

A 1-byte read outside allocated memory, that could theoretically produce
a bad compressed file, has been fixed.

Dictionary size limit has been reduced to 512MiB because setting it to
1GiB causes overflow of a 32 bit integer.

Lzdiff, a diff/cmp wrapper for gzip, bzip2 and lzip compressed files has
been added to the distribution.

Lzgrep, a grep wrapper for gzip, bzip2 and lzip compressed files has
been added to the distribution.

"make install-info" should now work on Debian and OS X.
