Changes in version 1.17:

The compression code has been reorganized to ease the porting of the
fast encoder to clzip and lzlib.

The new chapter "Quality assurance" has been added to the manual.

The targets "install-compress", "install-strip-compress",
"install-info-compress" and "install-man-compress" have been added to
the Makefile.
