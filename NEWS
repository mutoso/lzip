Changes in version 1.4:

This version produces version 1 files with support for safe recovery of
undamaged members from multimember files.

The new option "--member-size", that produces multimember files, has
been added.

The new option "--volume-size", that splits the compressed output into
several volume files, has been added.

The new option "--output", that sends output to a file when reading from
standard input, has been added.

This version is able to read from some types of non regular files if
"--stdout" is specified.

Lziprecover, a member recoverer program for lzip compressed files, has
been added to the distribution.

"testsuite/unzcrash.cc" now tests all 1-byte errors instead of only
1-bit errors.
