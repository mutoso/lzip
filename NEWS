Changes in version 1.16:

Compression ratio of option -9 has been slightly increased.

Compression time has been reduced by 4%.

"lzip -0" is now comparable in compression speed and ratio to "gzip -6".

Copying of file dates, permissions, and ownership now behaves like "cp -p".
(If the user ID or the group ID can't be duplicated, the file permission
bits S_ISUID and S_ISGID are cleared).

Some minor improvements have been made.

"lzip.texinfo" has been renamed to "lzip.texi".

The license has been changed to GPL version 2 or later.
