Changes in version 1.10:

File specified with option "-o" is now created with write permission for
all if umask allows it, and deleted if lzip is interrupted by the user.

Regular files are now open in binary mode in non-POSIX platforms
defining the O_BINARY macro.

Dictionary size for options -2, -3, -4 and -8 has been changed to
improve linearity of compressed sizes.

Compiler warnings produced by over-optimization (-O3) have been fixed.
