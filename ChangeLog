	* Compression speed has been improved.
	* Implemented bt4 type matchfinder.
	* Added chapter "Algorithm" to the manual.
	* Lzdiff and lzgrep now accept "-h" for "--help" and

	* Version 1.2 released.
	* encoder.cc: A 1-byte read outside allocated memory has been fixed.
	* lzip.h: Dictionary size limit has been reduced to 512MiB because
	  setting it to 1GiB causes overflow of a 32 bit integer.
	* Added "lzdiff", a diff/cmp wrapper for gzip, bzip2, lzip and
	  non-compressed files.
	* Added "lzgrep", a grep wrapper for gzip, bzip2, lzip and
