.SH SYNOPSIS
.B lzdiff
[\fIOPTIONS\fR] [\fIDIFF_OPTIONS\fR] \fIFILE1 \fR[\fIFILE2\fR]
.SH DESCRIPTION
Lzdiff \- Diff/cmp wrapper for compressed files.
.PP
Lzdiff is a wrapper script around the diff and cmp commands that allows
transparent comparison of any combination of compressed and
non\-compressed files. If any given file is compressed, its uncompressed
content is used. The supported compressors are gzip, bzip2 and lzip.
.PP
Compares FILE1 to FILE2. If FILE2 is omitted, compares FILE1 to the
uncompressed contents of FILE1.[gz|bz2|lz] (depending on the default
compressor selected). DIFF_OPTIONS are passed directly to diff or cmp.
The exit status from diff or cmp is preserved.
