.SH DESCRIPTION
Lzgrep \- Grep wrapper for compressed files.
.PP
Lzgrep is a wrapper script around the grep command that allows
transparent search on any combination of compressed and non\-compressed
files. If any given file is compressed, its uncompressed content is
used. If a given file does not exist, lzgrep tries the compressed file
name corresponding to the default compressor selected. The supported
compressors are gzip, bzip2 and lzip.
.PP
GREP_OPTIONS are passed directly to grep.
The exit status from grep is preserved.
